# PubLayNet

PubLayNet is a large dataset of document images, of which the layout is annotated with both bounding boxes and polygonal segmentations. The source of the documents is [PubMed Central Open Access Subset (commercial use collection)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/). The annotations are automatically generated by matching the PDF format and the XML format of the articles in the PubMed Central Open Access Subset. More details are available in our paper ["PubLayNet: largest dataset ever for document layout analysis."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07836).

## Headlines

`07/Mar/2022` - We have released the ground truth of the test set for the ICDAR 2021 Scientific Literature Parsing competition available [here!](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet/tree/master/ICDAR_SLR_competition/final_test_set).

`04/May/2021` - Report for the ICDAR 2021 Scientific Literature Parsing competition available [here](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet/blob/master/ICDAR_SLR_competition/ICDAR_2021_Scientific_Literature_Parsing.pdf).

`07/Aug/2020` - PDF of document pages in PubLayNet is [released](https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-publaynet/1.0.0/PubLayNet_PDF.tar.gz).

`20/Jul/2020` - PubLayNet is used in [ICDAR 2021 Competition on Scientific Literature Parsing](https://github.com/IBM/ICDAR2021-SLP) ([Task A on Document Layout Recognition](https://aieval.draco.res.ibm.com/challenge/41/overview))

`26/Apr/2020` - PubLayNet is used by ICLR 2020 to [extract all the images](https://twitter.com/srush_nlp/status/1253788694739386371) in ICLR 2020 papers for promotion.

`03/Dev/2019` - Pre-trained Faster-RCNN model and Mask-RCNN model are [released](pre-trained-models).

`25/Nov/2019` - [**PubTabNet**](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubTabNet) is released! PubTabNet is a large dataset for image-based table recognition, containing 568k+ images of tabular data annotated with the corresponding HTML representation of the tables. Table regions are identified using the same algorithm that generates PubLayNet.

`01/Nov/2019` - Our paper ["PubLayNet: largest dataset ever for document layout analysis."](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07836) receives the [**best paper award** at ICDAR 2019](http://icdar2019.org/award/)!

`31/Oct/2019` - PubLayNet migrates from Box to [**IBM Data Asset eXchange**](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/publaynet/).

## Updates in progress

### Ground truth of test set

We have released the ground truth of the test set for the ICDAR 2021 Scientific Literature Parsing competition available [here!](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet/tree/master/ICDAR_SLR_competition/final_test_set).

## Getting data

### The data set is no longer available from IBM and there is no current download site. If you have a copy of the data set, please reach to us through this [issue](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet/issues/46).

For the ICDAR competition, ids of the image files are available [here](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet/blob/master/ICDAR_SLR_competition/test_ids.json).

## Annotation format

The annotation files follows the [json format of the Object Detection task of MS COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#format-data)
